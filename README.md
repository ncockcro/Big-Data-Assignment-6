# Big-Data-Assignment-6

This assignment is intended to learn and experiment with the random tree forest model using Spark to implement it. This program takes in a file containing the type of animal in the first column, as well as several attributes that determine if the animal is a good pet or not for children. The random tree forest takes in this data to be trained and will output a prediction for each type of animal.
